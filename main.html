	<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity of an algorithm quantifies the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of the input. it makes us efficient programmers.</p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the total amount of memory space used by an algorithm/program, including the space of input values for execution. It is given by O(n).</p>
